# Plan:

## Critique previous visualization:

![dashboard 1 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25557540/32977366-e29f1ad2-cbe0-11e7-8247-2c284100b98e.png)

#### Pros:
* The First Visual tells the viewer these are the skills that SCU student possess  
* looking at the visualization the audience can see that SCU alumnus are placed in top companies 
* The Caption informs the viewer that SCU graduates have 70% skill 

#### Cons: 
* This dashboard is less for recruiters and more for future students 
* The objective of the visualization is not satisfied by this visual 
* Recruiter metrics needed 
* The caption 70% of skills recruiters are looking for is possed by SCU graduates needs to be shown in the visual 
* Data to pixel is not good, simple efficient colours must be used

## Objective of lab 6 - Use the collected data to design a dashboard on Santa Clara University’s MSIS program.

## Brief Summary:

* Developed metrics for the MSIS program.
* Evaluated and ranked the metrics for their suitability.
* Choose metrics that will be useful to the recruiters 

******************************************************************************************************************************


## Lab 8: 

* Claim: Why hire SCU Graduates?
* Qualifier: The qualifier that I have choosen is the student to teacher ratio, ranking of the universities in the bay, top skills and how selective is the program.
* Warrant: 
* Backing: 

******************************************************************************************************************************
## Final Visualization 
![dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25557540/32984175-3721d412-cc56-11e7-911b-c118e3169460.png)

Discussion: 

1) The Visual shows top companies in the bay area that have been hiring MSIS students which can lead a recruiter to think that MSIS students are credible and have a good knowledge base 
2) The visual now compares the top 10 skills from LinkedIn that recruiters look for in MSIS Graduates and the link that MSIS student have 
3) There are some major changes from the last visual.
4) Data to pixel ratio has been tried to keep as simple as can and so can be said about the clours
