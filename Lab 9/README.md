# Plan:

## Critique previous visualization:

![dashboard 1 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25557540/32977366-e29f1ad2-cbe0-11e7-8247-2c284100b98e.png)

#### Pros:
* The First Visual tells the viewer these are the skills that SCU student possess  
* looking at the visualization the audience can see that SCU alumnus are placed in top companies 
* The Caption informs the viewer that SCU graduates have 70% skill 

#### Cons: 
* This dashboard is less for recruiters and more for future students 
* The objective of the visualization is not satisfied by this visual 
* Recruiter metrics needed 
* The caption 70% of skills recruiters are looking for is possed by SCU graduates needs to be shown in the visual 
* Data to pixel is not good, simple efficient colours must be used 


******************************************************************************************************************************


## Objective of lab 6 - Use the collected data to design a dashboard on Santa Clara University’s MSIS program.

## Brief Summary:

* Developed metrics for the MSIS program.
* Evaluated and ranked the metrics for their suitability.
* Choose metrics that will be useful to the recruiters 

******************************************************************************************************************************


## Lab 8: 
* Audience: The audience for this data are the recruiters who are always looking to fill positions in their firms with qualified graduates  

**Claim: Why hire SCU Graduates?**

* Data: The data for this Lab has been taken from the shared folder for the MSIS SCU Project.The link is given below:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jjNTzv5Eo47Jby1pBffN9goL-s6Z1tpBNNQqNicJgMM/edit#gid=0

* Data Wrangling: The data wrangling steps have been written in the juypter notebook file.

* Qualifier: The qualifier that I have chosen is the skills recruiters look for and SCU student have and companies in the bay hiring SCU graduates

* Warrant: The warrant is discussed in the final Visualization section 
 
* Backing: There are many notable graduates that have done very well after graduating from MSIS program. Most of the graduating batch have a job offer from famous tech companies before they graduate. The link to notable alumni can is given below:

## Final Visualization 
![dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25557540/32984175-3721d412-cc56-11e7-911b-c118e3169460.png)

Discussion: 

1) The Visual shows top companies in the bay area that have been hiring MSIS students which can lead a recruiter to think that MSIS students are credible and have a good knowledge base 
2) Working Average shows how many alumni are working in the companies
3) MSIS students do also get hired for companies all over the world but the data represented here is to support the claim 
4) The visual  also now compares the top 10 skills from LinkedIn that recruiters look for in MSIS Graduates and the skills that MSIS student possess
5) Also now we can prove the earlier claim that 70% of skills that recruiters are looking for is present in graduates from SCU
6) I have kept  data to pixel ratio as simple as possible to have a deeper impact on the audience 


******************************************************************************************************************************
## Road map with Future Enhancements:

1. Improvement -  Collect more data on the alumni job profile 
* Benefit - A better map plot can be shown if the data is present as it bolsters the claim more and would show a lot of more companies 
2. Improvement - Collect data to show different business segments that alumni are in 
* Benefit - Again this will show the reach of the SCU network 
3. Improvement - Add data to discuss the graduating class profile and any achievements  
* Benefit - Seeing the graduating batch profile and potentials any achievement will the recruiters know easily will the graduates fit the profile
