******************************************************************************************************************************

## Approach:

**Data:** I collected data from 3 sources Top_Ranked_School_for_InformationTechnology-_San_Jose_CA, Management_InformationSystems(MIS) Salary and Salary_and_Job_Information_for_MIS_Majors.

**Qualifier:** I choose the comparision between 3 major university in the bay area to present a stronger case for my claim.

**Claim_1:** MSIS program is the best at Santa Clara University.

**Claim_2:** MSIS majors are paid very well!!!

**Warrant:** I tried to showcase that the Job market for the various MSIS specialization track is pretty hot right now which can have a very persuasive factor in deciding majors for students. I put in a comparison table for different universities in the bay area where I tried to showcase that Santa Clara University is a prominent well recognized university.

**Backing:** 
The comparison table is done to help the prospective student to decide on the university and it highlights the MSIS program at Santa Clara University to be the best among the three. So, people especially the ones planning to be in tech can choose SCU as it is at the heart of silicon valley and easily beats its competitors.
The data I have for MSIS tracks vs growth rate and MSIS track vs Major clearly showcase that MSIS specialization tracks are doing really well in the job market.
For the hiring managers, they can decide on the basis of the university standing and the average salary being paid for different specialization tracks in MSIS major when they decide to offer jobs to students.
