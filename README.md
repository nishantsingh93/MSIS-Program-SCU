# MSIS-Program-SCU

Approach:
Data: I collected data from 3 sources Top_Ranked_School_for_InformationTechnology-_San_Jose_CA, Management_InformationSystems(MIS) Salary and Salary_and_Job_Information_for_MIS_Majors.
Claim_1: MSIS program is the best at Santa Clara University.
Claim_2: MSIS majors are paid very well!!!
Warrant: I tried to showcase that the Job market for the various MSIS specialization track is pretty hot right now which can have a very persuasive factor on deciding majors for students. I put in a comparison table for different universities in the bay area where I tried to showcase that Santa Clara University is a prominent well recognized university.
Backing:
Qualifier: I choose the comparision between 3 major university in the bay area to present a stronger case for my claim.
